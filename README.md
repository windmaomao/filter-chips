# Chips Filter

A multi-chips select widget overall;
An auto-suggestion input box to the right, weâ€™ll make the chips select and the auto-suggestion box part of the same widget through smart UI touch up; a popover that provides suggestion so we can create the right chip;
Chip component, a button like item with a popover that provides grannual level control in terms of what can be filtered for that item;
I normally do a little bit of prototyping via Codepen, so that I know my idea can work in general before I code properly in a repo. While writing this doc, I made the prototype: https://codepen.io/windmaomao/pen/zYQZqXp . You can add a chip by selecting one of the items, and you can remove a chip by simply clicking on the chip. This is far from what we want, but more or less I want to convince myself this could work in the end.
